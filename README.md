# Experiments

An archive of experiments done to inform Penrose development.

After cloning this repo, you may not want to clone all the submodules
immediately, but at least initialize them:

```sh
git submodule init
```

The experiments are all self-contained and independent of each other. Most use a
Git submodule of the main Penrose repo at some particular point in history. To
dive into any particular experiment, start with the `README.md` file at the root
of its subdirectory.
