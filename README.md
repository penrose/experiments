# Experiments

An archive of experiments done to inform Penrose development.

Be sure to clone this repo with submodules enabled:

```sh
gh repo clone penrose/experiments -- --recurse-submodules
```

These are all self-contained and independent of each other. Most use a Git
submodule of the main Penrose repo at some particular point in history. To dive
into any particular experiment, start with the `README.md` file at the root of
its subdirectory.
