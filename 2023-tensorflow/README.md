# 2023 TensorFlow.js

author: [**@samestep**](http://github.com/samestep)

This experiment is to see how much slower Penrose is the autodiff engine is
replaced with [TensorFlow.js][].

## Results

All the data were gathered on my 2020 MacBook Pro with M1 chip. Each folder is
named according to the commit from the main [Penrose][] repo on which the code
was run.

For contrast, results from an experimental [Rose][] backend can be found in the
`rose` folder; these were gathered on commit `d75fbdd`. Also, results from a
JavaScript-emitting backend can be found in the `js` folder; these were gathered
on commit `349f248`.

If you have Python installed, run `./analyze.py` to generate `data.csv`
comparing TensorFlow.js and Rose. If you have Node installed, run
`./diagrams.mjs` to generate `diagrams.html`, which you can open in your browser
to print to a PDF comparing the diagrams generated by TensorFlow.js and Rose.
