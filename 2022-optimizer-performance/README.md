# 2022 Optimizer Performance

author: [**@samestep**](http://github.com/samestep)

This experiment is an attempt to get an idea of how much faster the Penrose
optimizer could possibly be, without fundamentally changing how it works.
Specifically, I naÃ¯vely rewrote the optimizer in Rust (i.e. direct translation,
nothing clever) and modified our autodiff code generator to produce C code
instead of JavaScript. I also added a counter to the optimizer to see how many
times it called the generated gradient function. Then I timed both the original
JavaScript optimizer and the native optimizer (including the time it takes to
actually compile the Rust and generated C code) and compared them, in each case
separating out the total time it takes to call the generated gradient function
from the time spent in the rest of the optimizer.

## Results

Not including the time it takes to compile the C and Rust code, the native
optimizer is consistently 1-2 orders of magnitude faster. Compilation time often
dominates (in which case it is not shown as an explicit bar in the chart), but
not always.

Note that to measure the time for just calling the gradient, I just repeatedly
pass the final state of the diagram (rather than separately passing each of the
many states) in a loop. The assumption is that the performance of the gradient
function should be similar regardless of what inputs it is passed. An example
that indicates the flaws in this assumption is
`one-water-molecule-atoms-and-bonds`, for which it takes more time to call the
gradient function in a loop like that than it takes to just run the entire
optimizer, so the chart shows the difference as a negative number.

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Usage

All commands in this README assume your working directory is the directory
containing this README. You'll first need to clone the Penrose repo submodule:

```sh
git submodule update penrose
```

This experiment requires some changes to the Penrose repo, stored in
`penrose.patch`. To apply those changes, run this command:

```sh
git -C penrose apply ../penrose.patch
```

Then to build and run the experiment, run this command:

```sh
./run.sh
```

Results should appear in the `results/` folder.

## Development

If you make further changes and want to re-export them to the patch file, run
this command:

```sh
git -C penrose diff > penrose.patch
```

To clear changes to the Penrose repo (for instance, if you want to freshly
re-apply `penrose.patch`):

```sh
git -C penrose restore .
```

After running the experiment, if you want to verify that the Rust version of the
optimizer actually worked correctly, run this to regenerate `penrose/diagrams/`:

```sh
./render.sh
```

Once you're satisfied looking at the diagrams, you'll probably want to restore
them in case you're planning to use the above command to update `penrose.patch`:

```sh
git -C penrose restore diagrams
```
